# EventSphere

Welcome to EventSphere! This is a dynamic web application built using ASP.NET 8 MVC, designed to cater to the needs of both companies organizing events and users seeking event-related information. EventSphere provides a platform where companies can dynamically modify event information, present event details to customers, perform CRUD operations on events, and manage user messages. Users, on the other hand, can access event information, submit queries, and interact with the system.

## Features

- **Dynamic Event Management**: Companies can dynamically modify event information, ensuring up-to-date details for customers.
- **Event Information Presentation**: Customers can access comprehensive event-related information through the website.
- **CRUD Operations on Events**: Companies have the flexibility to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on events.
- **User Message Management**: Companies can view and manage messages submitted by users, facilitating effective communication.
- **User Authentication**: The system incorporates .NET Identity for user authentication, ensuring secure access to features and data.
